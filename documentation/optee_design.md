# 1. Introduction
OP-TEE is a so called Trusted Execution Environment, in short a TEE, for ARM
based chips supporting TrustZone technology. OP-TEE consists of three
components.

+ OP-TEE Client ([optee_client](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_client)), which
  is the client API running in normal world user space.
+ OP-TEE Linux Kernel device driver
  ([optee_linuxdriver](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_linuxdriver)), which is the
  device driver that handles the communication between normal world user space
  and secure world.
+ OP-TEE Trusted OS ([optee_os](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os)), which is the
  Trusted OS running in secure world.
  
OP-TEE was designed with scalability and portability in mind and as of now it
has been ported to a handful of different platforms, both ARMv7-A and ARMv8-A
from different vendors 
(see
 [README.md](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/README.md#platforms-supported)).

# 2. Platform initialization

When reading this section, please have a look at the illustration just below,
which would make it a bit easier to follow what is happening in the different
steps.

1. When the system boots up, the entry function, `tz_sinit`, specified in the
   linker script
   ([tz-template.lds](../core/arch/arm/plat-stm/tz-template.lds)) will be
   called. This function will initialize all cores. Main setup is done using a
   single core and let the other cores wait until a certain point in the
   initialization phase has been reached, which then also will release the other
   cores. This function is also responsible of configuring the cache and set up
   the MMU.

2. During this phase the `main_init`, `main_init_helper` functions will be
   called for each core. These init functions are responsible of taking care of
   setting up the UART, clear the BSS section, setup canaries (used to find
   buffer overflows), initialize the GIC and register the monitor vector table.
   It is also in these functions where you are registering the thread handler.
   I.e, the handler that points to the functions to be called when you enter
   secure world.

# 3. Secure Monitor Calls - SMC
## 3.1 SMC handling
The communication between normal world and secure world is achieved using SMC
exceptions. During platform initialization (see the section about platform
initialization above) there is a vector table registered called the monitor
vector table. The way to register this is by writing to the register MVBAR. The
monitor vector table states the functions to be called when a SMC exception
occurs. In the current design the monitor is listening for two exceptions which
are regular SMC calls and FIQ requests ([see,
sm_vect_table in sm_a32.S](../core/arch/arm/sm/sm_a32.S)).

The picture below shows and describes the main flow for a standard SMC call in
OP-TEE. 

1. Coming from normal world, this call is initiated in the TEE device
   driver in the Linux kernel. The first thing done is to put the parameter(s)
   according to the TEE SMC Interface and then generate the SMC exception by
   calling `smc #0`.

2. The exception will be trapped in the monitor which will do
   some bookkeeping and decide where to go next by looking at `SRC.NS` (by
   looking at SRC.NS we know which side we were coming from).
   
3. When it goes into secure world, the first thing that happens is that a thread
   will be assigned for the task. When that has been done the thread will
   start/resume from the PC stored in the context belonging to the thread. In
   the case when it is a standard call, the function `thread_alloc_and_run`
   ([thread.c](../core/arch/arm/kernel/thread.c)) will be called. In this
   function the Trusted OS will try to find an unused thread for the new
   request. If there isn't any thread available (all existing threads already in
   use), then the Trusted OS will return back `TEESMC_RETURN_EBUSY`
   ([teesmc.h](../core/arch/arm/include/sm/teesmc.h)) to the normal world. If
   an unused thread was found the Trusted OS will copy relevant registers,
   preparing the PC to jump to, namely the function `thread_std_smc_entry`. When
   all that has been done, the thread is prepared to be started.

4. When the thread is started (or resuming) the function `thread_std_smc_entry`
   ([thread_a32.S](../core/arch/arm/kernel/thread_a32.S)) will be called,
   which in turn will call the `thread_stdcall_handler_ptr` that is pointing to
   the function used when registering the thread handlers. Normally this points
   to the `main_tee_entry` function
   ([entry.c](../core/arch/arm/plat-vexpress/main.c)). But in case the
   platform we are intended to work with doesn't require any special handling
   one can ignore calling (and register this function) and instead directly call
   the generic `tee_entry` function.

5. `tee_entry` will call any of the pre-defined services in TEE core.

Below you will find a more detailed illustration of what will happen in the
different stages in the call flow. Pay attention to the function
`thread_std_smc_entry`, which is the location where we actually jump back to the
normal world (via the Secure Monitor).

## 3.2 TEE SMC Interface
TEE SMC Interface ([teesmc.h](../core/arch/arm/include/sm/teesmc.h)) is the interface
used to communicate TEE related data between normal and secure world. The main
structure used for this communication is:

	struct teesmc32_arg {
	        uint32_t cmd;
	        uint32_t ta_func;
	        uint32_t session;
	        uint32_t ret;
	        uint32_t ret_origin;
	        uint32_t num_params;
	#if 0
	        /*
	         * Commented out elements used to visualize the layout dynamic part
	         * of the struct. Note that these fields are not available at all
	         * if num_params == 0.
	         *
	         * params is accessed through the macro TEESMC32_GET_PARAMS
	         */

	        struct teesmc32_param params[num_params];
	#endif
	}

* `cmd` is one of
	* `TEESMC_CMD_OPEN_SESSION`: Which is used when establishing a session
	   between normal and secure world.
	* `TEESMC_CMD_INVOKE_COMMAND`: Which is the main command used when
	   invoking functions in the Trusted OS and/or Trusted Applications.
	* `TEESMC_CMD_CLOSE_SESSION`: Used to close the session between normal
	   and secure world.
	* `TEESMC_CMD_CANCEL`: Used to cancel a pending command.
* `ta_func` is the function id for the specific function to be called within the
   Trusted Application. This is only used when `cmd` is
   `TEESMC_CMD_INVOKE_COMMAND` since the other commands never directly talk with
   the Trusted Applications.
* `session` is the TEE session that is shared between the both worlds. This
   variable will be initialized when opening a new session by calling
   `TEESMC_CMD_OPEN_SESSION`.
* `ret` is the return value either from the Trusted OS or the Trusted
   Application.
* `ret_origin` is the origin for the return value. This is a important
   information, since OP-TEE spans other  a couple of different layers (normal
   world user space, Linux kernel, Secure Monitor, Trusted OS and Trusted
   Applications).
* `num_params` tells how many parameters that has been provided and used by this
   structure.
* `params` all parameters are allocated at the end of the structure. There
   can be 0..n `num_params` allocated.

## 3.3 Communication using TEE SMC Interface
If we are looking into the source code, we could see that communication mainly
is achieved using `teesmc32_arg`, `smc_param` and `thread_smc_args`, where
`teesmc32_arg` could be seen as the main structure. What will happen is that the
[TEE driver](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_linuxdriver) will get the
parameters either from [normal world user
space](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_client) or directly from an internal
service in the Linux kernel. The TEE driver will populate the struct
`teesmc32_arg` with the parameters plus some additional bookkeeping information.
The secure monitor uses the smc_param structure, so just before issuing the SMC,
the kernel will assign the `teesmc32_arg` structure, setting whether it is a
std- or fastcall withing the `smc_param` structure. As the final step in the
TEE driver the SMC will be issued. The relation between the structures involved
has been illustrated below.

![SMC structure relations](images/smc_structure_relations.png "SMC structure relations")

# 4. Thread handling
The Trusted OS uses a couple of threads to be able to support running jobs in
parallel (not fully enabled!). There are handlers for different purposes. In
[`thread.c`](../core/arch/arm/kernel/thread.c) you will
find a function called `thread_init_handlers` which assigns handlers (functions)
that should be called when Trusted OS receives standard or fast calls, FIQ,
SVC and ABORT and even PSCI calls. These handlers are platform specific,
therefore this is something that needs to be implemented by each platform.

## Synchronization
OP-TEE has three primitives for synchronization of threads and CPUs:
spin-lock, mutex, and condvar.

### Spin-lock
A spin-lock is represented as an `unsigned int`. This is the most primitive
lock. Interrupts should be disabled before attempting to take a spin-lock
and should remain disabled until the lock is released.

A spin-lock is initialized with `SPINLOCK_UNLOCK`.

`cpu_spin_lock()` locks a spin-lock

`cpu_spin_trylock()` locks a spin-lock if unlocked and returns `0` else
the spin-lock is unchanged and the function returns `!0`.

`cpu_spin_unlock()` unlocks a spin-lock

### Mutex
A mutex is represented by `struct mutex`. A mutex can be locked and
unlocked with interrupts enabled or disabled, but only from a normal
thread. A mutex can't be used in an interrupt handler, abort handler or
before a thread has been selected for the CPU.

A mutex is initialized with either `MUTEX_INITIALIZER` or `mutex_init()`.

`mutex_lock()` locks a mutex. If the mutex is unlocked this is a fast
operation, else the function issues an RPC to wait in normal world.

`mutex_unlock()` unlocks a mutex. If there's no waiters this is a fast
operation, else the function issues an RPC to wake up a waiter in normal
world.

`mutex_trylock()` locks a mutex if unlocked and returns `true` else the
mutex is unchanged and the function returns `false`.

`mutex_destroy()` asserts that the mutex is unlocked and there's no
waiters, after this the memory used by the mutex can be freed.

When a mutex is locked it's owned by the thread calling `mutex_lock()` or
`mutex_trylock()`, the mutex may only be unlocked by the thread owning the
mutex.

A thread should not exit to TA user space when holding a mutex.

### Condvar
A condvar is represented by `struct condvar`. A condvar is similar to a
pthread_condvar_t in the pthreads standard, only less advanced. Condition
variables are used to wait for some condition to be fulfilled and are
always used together a mutex. Once a condition variable has been used
together with a certain mutex, it must only be used with that mutex until
destroyed.

A condvar is initialized with `CONDVAR_INITIALIZER` or `condvar_init()`.

`condvar_wait()` atomically unlocks the supplied mutex and waits in normal
world via an RPC for the condition variable to be signaled, when the
function returns the mutex is locked again.

`condvar_signal()` wakes up one waiter of the condition variable (waiting
in `condvar_wait()`)

`condvar_broadcast()` wake up all waiters of the condition variable.

The caller of `condvar_signal()` or `condvar_broadcast()` should hold the
mutex associated with the condition variable to guarantee that a waiter
doesn't miss the signal.

# 5. MMU
## Translation tables
OP-TEE uses several L1 translation tables, one large spanning 4 GiB and two
or more small tables spanning 32 MiB. The large translation table handles
kernel mode mapping and matches all addresses not covered by the small
translation tables. The small translation tables are assigned per thread
and covers the mapping of the virtual memory space for one TA context.

Memory space between small and large translation table is configured by
TTBRC. TTBR1 always points to the large translation table. TTBR0 points to
the a small translation table when user mapping is active and to the large
translation table when no user mapping is currently active.

The translation tables has certain alignment constraints, the alignment (of
the physical address) has to be the same as the size of the translation
table. The translation tables are statically allocated to avoid fragmentation of
memory due to the alignment constraints.

Each thread has one small L1 translation table of its own. Each TA context
has a compact representation of its L1 translation table. The compact
representation is used to initialize the thread specific L1 translation
table when the TA context is activated.

![Select xlation table](images/xlat_table.png "Select xlation table")

## Translation tables and switching to normal world
When switching to normal world either via an IRQ or RPC there's a chance
that secure world will resume execution on a different CPU. This means that
the new CPU need to be configured with the context of the currently active
TA. This is solved by always setting the TA context in the CPU when
resuming execution. Here's room for improvements since it's more likely
than not that it's the same CPU that resumes execution in secure world.

# 6. Stacks
Different stacks are used during different stages. The stacks are:
- Secure monitor stack (128 bytes), bound to the CPU. Only available if
  OP-TEE is compiled with a secure monitor always the case if the target is
  ARMv7-A but never for ARMv8-A.
- Temp stack (small ~1KB), bound to the CPU. Used when transitioning from
  one state to another. Interrupts are always disabled when using this
  stack, aborts are fatal when using the temp stack.
- Abort stack (medium ~2KB), bound to the CPU. Used when trapping a data
  or pre-fetch abort. Aborts from user space are never fatal the TA is only
  killed. Aborts from kernel mode are used by the pager to do the demand
  paging, if pager is disabled all kernel mode aborts are fatal.
- Thread stack (large ~8KB), not bound to the CPU instead used by the current
  thread/task. Interrupts are usually enabled when using this stack.

*Notes for ARMv7/AArch32:*

| Stack  | Comment |
|--------|---------|
| Temp   | Assigned to `SP_SVC` during entry/exit, always assigned to `SP_IRQ` and `SP_FIQ`
| Abort  | Always assigned to `SP_ABT`
| Thread | Assigned to `SP_SVC` while a thread is active

*Notes for AArch64:*
There's only two stack pointers, `SP_EL1` and `SP_EL0`, available for
OP-TEE in AArch64. When an exception is received stack pointer is always
`SP_EL1` which is used temporarily while assigning an appropriate stack
pointer for `SP_EL0`. **`SP_EL1` is always assigned the value of
`thread_core_local[cpu_id]`.** This structure have some spare space for
temporary storage of registers and also keeps the relevant stack pointers.
In general when we talk about assigning a stack pointer to the CPU below we
mean `SP_EL0`

## Boot
During early boot the CPU is configured with the temp stack which is used
until OP-TEE exits to normal world the first time.

*Notes for AArch64:*
`SPSEL` is always `0` on entry/exit to have `SP_EL0` acting as stack
pointer.

## Normal entry
Each time OP-TEE is entered from normal world the temp stack is used
as the initial stack. For fast calls this is the only stack used. For
normal calls an empty thread slot is selected and the CPU switches to
that stack.

## Normal exit
Normal exit occurs when a thread has finished its task and the thread is
freed. When the main thread function, tee_entry_std(), returns interrupts
are disabled and the CPU switches to the temp stack instead. The thread
is freed and OP-TEE exits to normal world.

## RPC exit
RPC exit occurs when OP-TEE need some service from normal world. RPC can
currently only be performed with a thread is in running state. RPC is
initiated with a call to thread_rpc() which saves the state in a way that
when the thread is restored it will continue at the next instruction as if
this function did a normal return. CPU switches to use the temp stack
before returning to normal world.

## IRQ exit
IRQ exit occurs when OP-TEE receives an IRQ, which is always handled in
normal world. IRQ exit is similar to RPC exit but it's thread_irq_handler()
that saves the thread state instead. The thread is resumed in the same way
though.

*Notes for ARMv7/AArch32:*
SP_IRQ is initialized to temp stack instead of a separate stack.  Prior to
exiting to normal world CPU state is changed to SVC and temp stack is
selected.

*Notes for AArch64:*
`SP_EL0` is assigned temp stack and is selected during IRQ processing. The
original `SP_EL0` is saved in the thread context to be restored when
resuming.

## Resume entry
OP-TEE is entered using the temp stack in the same way as for normal entry.
The thread to resume is looked up and the state is restored to resume
execution. The procedure to resume from an RPC exit or an IRQ exit is
exactly the same.

## Syscall
Syscalls are executed using the thread stack.

*Notes for ARMv7/AArch32*:
Nothing special `SP_SVC` is already set with thread stack.

*Notes for syscall AArch64*:

Early in the exception processing the original `SP_EL0` is saved in `struct
thread_svc_regs` in case the TA is executed in AArch64.

Current thread stack is assigned to `SP_EL0` which is then selected.

When returning `SP_EL0` is assigned what's in `struct thread_svc_regs`.
This allows `tee_svc_sys_return_helper()` having the syscall exception
handler return directly to `thread_unwind_user_mode()`.

# 7. Shared Memory

Shared Memory is a block of memory that is shared between the non-secure
and the secure world. It is used to transfer data between both worlds.

## Shared Memory Allocation
The shared memory is allocated by the Linux driver from a pool
`struct shm_pool`. The pool contains:
* the physical address of the start of the pool
* the size of the pool
* whether or not the memory is cached
* list of chunk of memory allocated.

Note that
- the shared memory pool is physically contiguous.
- the shared memory area is not protected as it is used by both
  non-secure and secure world.

### Shared Memory Configuration
It is the Linux kernel driver for OP-TEE that is responsible for initializing
the shared memory pool,
given information provided by the Trusted OS. The Linux driver issues a SMC call
TEESMC32_OPTEE_FASTCALL_GET_SHM_CONFIG to retrieve the information
* physical address of the start of the pool
* size of the pool
* whether or not the memory is cached

The shared memory pool configuration is platform specific. The memory mapping,
including the area MEM_AREA_NSEC_SHM (shared memory with non-secure world), is
retrieved by calling the platform-specific function `bootcfg_get_memory()`.
Please refer to this function and the area type MEM_AREA_NSEC_SHM to see
the configuration for the platform of interest.

The Linux driver will then initialize the shared memory pool accordingly.

### Shared Memory Chunk Allocation
A chunk of shared memory consists of the start address of the chunk,
its size and also a reference counter. Right after the configuration of
the shared
memory pool, a unique chunk is created, being the whole shared memory
area, with a reference count set to 0.

Then a new chunk of memory is created on request. Chunk creation
consists of:
- Select the smallest free chunk (refcount==0) that fits size and
  alignment constraint.
- Allocation will fail if no such chunk could be found.
- Split the found chunk in order to create a memory chunk with given
  specification (size / alignment, and refcount=1), and create
  potentially 2 smaller empty chunks.

## Shared Memory Usage

### From the Client Application
The client application can ask for shared memory allocation using the Global
Platform Client API function TEEC_AllocateSharedMemory().

The client application can also provide shared memory through the
GlobalPlatform Client API function TEEC_RegisterSharedMemory(). In such a case,
the provided memory must be physically contiguous so that
the Trusted OS, that does not handle scatter-gather memory, is able to use
the provided range of memory addresses.

Note that the reference count of a shared memory chunk is incremented
when shared memory is registered, and initialized to 1 on allocation.

### From the Linux Driver
Occasionally the Linux kernel driver needs to allocate shared memory
for the communication with secure world, for example when
using buffers of type TEEC_TempMemoryReference.

### From the Trusted OS
In case the Trusted OS needs information from the TEE supplicant (dynamic
TA loading, REE time request,...), shared memory must be allocated.
Allocation depends on the use case.

The Trusted OS asks for the following shared memory allocation:
- `teesmc32_arg` structure, used to pass the arguments to the non-secure world,
  where the allocation will be done by sending a
  TEESMC_RPC_FUNC_ALLOC_ARG message
- In some cases, a payload might be needed for storing the result from
  TEE supplicant, for example when trying to get the REE time.
  This type of allocation will be done by sending the message
  TEESMC_OPTEE_RPC_FUNC_ALLOC_PAYLOAD, which then will return:
  - the physical address of the shared memory
  - a handle to the memory, that later on will be used later on
    when freeing this memory.

### From the TEE Supplicant
The TEE supplicant is also working with shared memory, used to exchange
data between normal and secure worlds. Two cases are considered:
- The TEE supplicant receives a memory address from the
  Trusted OS, used to store the data. This is for example the
  case when REE time is requested. In this case, the
  TEE supplicant must register the provided shared memory in the same
  way a client application would do, involving the Linux driver.
- The TEE supplicant provides a new shared memory that contains
  the result. This is the case when a Trusted Application is dynamically
  loaded. In this case, the TEE supplicant must allocate
  a shared memory in the same way a client application would do,
  involving the Linux driver.

# 8. Pager
OP-TEE currently requires ~256 KiB RAM for OP-TEE kernel memory. This is
not a problem if OP-TEE uses TrustZone protected DDR, but for security
reasons OP-TEE may need to use TrustZone protected SRAM instead. The amount
of available SRAM varies between platforms, from just a few KiB up to over
512 KiB. Platforms with just a few KiB of SRAM can’t be expected to be able
to run a complete TEE solution in SRAM. But those with 128 to 256 KiB of
SRAM can be expected to have a capable TEE solution in SRAM.

The pager provides a solution to this by demand paging readonly parts of
OP-TEE using virtual memory.

## Secure memory
TrustZone protected SRAM is generally considered more secure than
TrustZone protected DRAM as there's usually more attack vectors on DRAM.
The attack vectors are hardware dependent and can be different for
different platforms.

## Backing store
TrustZone protected DRAM or in some cases non-secure DRAM is used as
backing store. The data in the backing store is integrity protected with
one hash (SHA-256) per page (4KiB). Only readonly pages are kept in backing
store for performance reasons as readwrite data would need to be encrypted
too. Readonly pages doesn't need to be encrypted since the OP-TEE binary
itself is not encrypted.

## Partitioning of memory
The code that handles demand paging must always be available as it would
otherwise lead to deadlock. The virtual memory is partitioned as:

```
  Type      Sections
+---------+-----------------+
|         | text            |
|         | rodata          |
|         | data            |
| unpaged | bss             |
|         | heap1           |
|         | nozi            |
|         | heap2           |
+---------+-----------------+
| init /  | text_init       |
| paged   | rodata_init     |
+---------+-----------------+
| paged   | text_pageable   |
|         | rodata_pageable |
+---------+-----------------+
| demand  |                 |
| alloc   |                 |
+---------+-----------------+
```
Where "nozi" stands for "not zero initialized", this section contains small
stacks and translation tables.

The "init" area is available when OP-TEE is initializing and
contains everything that is needed to initialize the pager. After the pager
has been initialized this area will be used for demand paged instead.

The "demand alloc" area is a special area where the pages are allocated and
removed from the pager on demand. Those pages are returned when OP-TEE
doesn't need them any longer. The thread stacks currently belongs this
area. This means that when a stack isn't used the physical pages can be used
by the pager for better performance.

The technique to gather code in the different area is based on compiling
all functions and data into separate sections. The unpaged text and rodata
is then gathered by linking all object files with `--gc-sections` to
eliminate sections that are outside the dependency graph of the entry
functions for unpaged functions. A script analyzes this ELF file and
generates the bits of the final link script. The process is repeated for
init text and rodata.  What isn't "unpaged" or "init" becomes "paged".

## Partitioning of the binary
The binary is partitioned into four parts as:
```
+----------+
| Header   |
+----------+
| Init     |
+----------+
| Hashes   |
+----------+
| Pageable |
+----------+
```
Header is defined as:
```
#define OPTEE_MAGIC             0x4554504f
#define OPTEE_VERSION           1
#define OPTEE_ARCH_ARM32        0
#define OPTEE_ARCH_ARM64        1

struct optee_header {
        uint32_t magic;
        uint8_t version;
        uint8_t arch;
        uint16_t flags;
        uint32_t init_size;
        uint32_t init_load_addr_hi;
        uint32_t init_load_addr_lo;
        uint32_t init_mem_usage;
        uint32_t paged_size;
};
```
The header is only used by the loader of OP-TEE, not OP-TEE itself. To
initialize OP-TEE the loader loads the complete binary into memory and
copies what follows the header and the following ```init_size``` bytes to
```(init_load_addr_hi << 32 | init_load_addr_lo)```. ```init_mem_usage``` is
used by the loader to be able to check that there's enough physical memory
available for OP-TEE to be able to initialize at all. The loader supplies
the address of the first byte following what wasn't copied in r0/x0 and jumps
to the load address to start OP-TEE.

## Initializing the pager
The pager is initialized as early as possible during boot in order to
minimize the "init" area. As a consequence of this the old initialization
has been broken up a bit since the pager initialization depends on some
internal APIs being available.

The global variable `tee_mm_vcore` describes the virtual memory range that
is covered by the level 2 translation table supplied to `tee_pager_init()`.

### Assign pageable areas
A virtual memory range to be handled by the pager is registered with a
call to `tee_pager_add_area()`.
```
bool tee_pager_add_area(tee_mm_entry_t *mm, uint32_t flags, const void *store,
                    const void *hashes);
```
which takes a pointer to `tee_mm_entry_t` to tell
the range, flags to tell how memory should be mapped (readonly, execute
etc), and pointers to backing store and hashes of the pages.

### Assign physical pages
Physical SRAM pages are supplied by calling `tee_pager_add_pages()`
```
void tee_pager_add_pages(tee_vaddr_t vaddr, size_t npages, bool unmap);
```
`tee_pager_add_pages()` expects all physical memory to be mapped in the
level 2 translation table already. `tee_pager_add_pages()` takes physical
address stored in the entry mapping the virtual address "vaddr" and
"npages" entries after that and uses it to map new pages when needed. The
unmap parameter tells whether the pages should be unmapped immediately
since they doesn't contain initialized data or be kept mapped until they
need to be recycled.

The pages in the "init" area are supplied with unmap == false since those
page have valid content and are in use.

## Invocation
The pager is invoked as part of the abort handler. A pool of physical pages
are used to map different virtual addresses. When a new virtual address
needs to be mapped a free physical page is mapped at the new address, if a
free physical page can't be found the oldest physical page is selected
instead. When the page is mapped new data is copied from backing store and
the hash of the page is verified. If it's OK the pager returns from the
exception to resume the execution.

# 9. Cryptographic abstraction layer
Cryptographic operations are implemented inside the TEE core by the
[LibTomCrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt) library. An abstraction
layer allows for replacing the default implementation, as explained in
[crypto.md](crypto.md).

# 11. Trusted Applications
## Format
Trusted Applications consists of a signed ELF file.

The format a TA is:
```
<Signed header>
<ELF>
```

Where `<ELF>` is the content of a standard ELF file and `<Signed header>`
consists of:

| Type | Name | Comment |
|------|------|---------|
| `uint32_t` | magic | Holds the magic number `0x4f545348` |
| `uint32_t` | img_type | image type, values defined by enum shdr_img_type |
| `uint32_t` | img_size | image size in bytes |
| `uint32_t` | algo | algorithm, defined by public key algorithms `TEE_ALG_*` from TEE Internal API specification |
| `uint16_t` | hash_size | size of the signed hash |
| `uint16_t` | sig_size | size of the signature |
| `uint8_t[hash_size]` | hash | Hash of the fields above and the `<ELF>` above |
| `uint8_t[sig_size]` | signature | Signature of hash |
