This directory shall store the device tree bindings documentation.

When a binding is already described in the Linux kernel source tree,
please refer there for bindings information. Latest Linux kernel release
is the reference for DT bindings.

For the bindings not described in the the Linux kernel source tree, one can
find here the expected description. Please use the conventional format
for DT bindings documentation, currently plain ASCII text files.
