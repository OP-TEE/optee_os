# OP-TEE - version 1.1.0


## New features

* Softfloat library: floating point support is now available in 32bits TA.

* Support running 64-bits TA: on ARMv8-A platform, TA can be compiled in
  AArch32 and/or in AArch64 in case the core is compiled in AArch64.
  An example can be found in HiKey configuration file. Using the following
  excerpt code, the user TA libraries are compiled in both AArch32 and
  AArch64, and can be found in `out/arm-plat-hikey/export-ta_arm32` and
  `out/arm-plat-hikey/export-ta_arm64`

```
    ta-targets = ta_arm32
    ta-targets += ta_arm64
```

* Concurrent TA support: multiple TA can run in parallel on
  several cores.

* New tests added in xtest test suite: concurrent TA (xtest 1013),
  floating point tests (xtest 1006 and os_test TA) and corruption
  file storage (xtest 20000)

* [Link][github_commits_1_1_0] to a list of all commits between this and
  previous release.

# OP-TEE - version 1.0.0

OP-TEE is now maintained by Linaro. Contributors do not need to
sign a CLA anymore, but must follow the rules of the [DCO][DCO]
(Developer Certificate of Origin) instead.


## New features

* Add hardware support for Texas Instruments DRA7xx, ARMv7 (plat-ti)

* GlobalPlatform™ TEE Internal Core API Specification v1.1,
  including ECC algorithms.

* Secure Storage: Files stored by the REE are now encrypted. Operations
  are made atomic in order to prevent inconsistencies in case of errors
  during the storage operations. [Slides][LCStorage] describing the
  Secure Storage have been presented at the Linaro Connect SFO15.

* Change of format of the Trusted Applications: they follow a
  [signed ELF format][elf]

* Rework thread [synchronization][synchro] in optee_os.

* Use of ARMv8 native cryptographic support.

* [OP-TEE/optee_test][optee_test] test suite is released.

* Introduce [OP-TEE/manifest][manifest] and [OP-TEE/build][build]
  to setup and build QEMU, FVP, HiKey and Mediatek platforms. Setup scripts
  that used to be in optee_os have been removed, except for Juno board.

  previous release.

# OP-TEE - version 0.3.0

## New features

*   Add hardware support for
	*   Mediatek MT8173 Board, ARMv8-A (plat-mediatek)
	*   Hisilicon HiKey Board, ARMv8-A (plat-hikey)
*   AArch64 build of optee_os is now possible through the configuration `CFG_ARM64_core=y`
*	Secure Storage: Data can be encrypted prior to their storage in the non-secure.
	Build is configured using `CFG_ENC_FS=y`
*	A generic boot scheme can be used. Boot configuration is commonalized. This helps
	new board support. It is applied on plat-hikey, plat-vexpress, plat-mediatek, plat-stm
    and plat-vexpress.

# OP-TEE - version 0.2.0

## New features

### Linux Driver Refactoring

Linux Driver has been refactored. It is now split in two parts:
*	optee.ko, the generic Linux driver. It contains all functionality
	common to all backends.
*	optee_armtz.ko, a specific backend dedicated to the TrustZone optee.
	It depends on optee.ko.

Loading the TrustZone optee linux driver module is now performed using

    modprobe optee_armtz

Thanks to the dependency between the generic and the backend modules, optee.ko is then automatically loaded.

### Misc new features
* support PL310 lock down at TEE boot
* add 64bits support (division / print)

## Issues resolved since last release
*	Fix user TA trace issue, in order each TA is able to select its own trace level

## Issues resolved since last release
N/A since this is the first release tag on OP-TEE.


## Known issues
*   Storage is implemented, but not "Secure storage", meaning that a client
    needs to do encrypt files on their own before storing the files.

*   Issue(s) open on GitHub
    *   [#95][pr95]: An error about building the test code of libtomcrypt.

    *   [#149][pr149]: when testing optee os with arm trusted firmware (I
	utilized optee os tee.bin as bl32 image) on juno platform, I got an
        error.

    *   [#161][pr161]: tee_svc_cryp.c lacks accessibility checks on
        user-supplied TEE_Attributes.
