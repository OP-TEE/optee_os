# OP-TEE - version 0.3.0

## New features

*   Add hardware support for
	*   Mediatek MT8173 Board, ARMv8-A (plat-mediatek)
	*   Hisilicon HiKey Board, ARMv8-A (plat-hikey)
*   AArch64 build of optee_os is now possible through the configuration `CFG_ARM64_core=y`
*	Secure Storage: Data can be encrypted prior to their storage in the non-secure.
	Build is configured using `CFG_ENC_FS=y`
*	A generic boot scheme can be used. Boot configuration is commonalized. This helps
	new board support. It is applied on plat-hikey, plat-vexpress, plat-mediatek, plat-stm
    and plat-vexpress.

## Tested on

| Type | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| Standard tests | The optee_test project. |
| Extended tests | optee_test with tests from the GlobalPlatform™ TEE Initial Configuration Test Suite v1.1.0.4. |
| Hello world test | Plain hello world Trusted Application such as [this][hello_world]. |

*	ARM Juno Board (vexpress-juno), standard tests.
*	Foundation Models (vexpress-fvp), standard tests.
*	HiKey (hikey), standard tests.
*	MT8173 (mediatek), standard tests.
*	QEMU (vexpress-qemu), standard + extended tests.
*	STM Cannes (stm-cannes), standard + extended tests.

# OP-TEE - version 0.2.0

## New features

### Linux Driver Refactoring

Linux Driver has been refactored. It is now split in two parts:
*	optee.ko, the generic Linux driver. It contains all functionality
	common to all backends.
*	optee_armtz.ko, a specific backend dedicated to the TrustZone optee.
	It depends on optee.ko.

Loading the TrustZone optee linux driver module is now performed using

    modprobe optee_armtz

Thanks to the dependency between the generic and the backend modules, optee.ko is then automatically loaded.

### Misc new features
* support PL310 lock down at TEE boot
* add 64bits support (division / print)

## Issues resolved since last release
*	Fix user TA trace issue, in order each TA is able to select its own trace level

## Issues resolved since last release
N/A since this is the first release tag on OP-TEE.


## Known issues
*   Storage is implemented, but not "Secure storage", meaning that a client
    needs to do encrypt files on their own before storing the files.

*   Issue(s) open on GitHub
    *   [#95][pr95]: An error about building the test code of libtomcrypt.

    *   [#149][pr149]: when testing optee os with arm trusted firmware (I
	utilized optee os tee.bin as bl32 image) on juno platform, I got an
        error.

    *   [#161][pr161]: tee_svc_cryp.c lacks accessibility checks on
        user-supplied TEE_Attributes.
