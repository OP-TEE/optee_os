# OP-TEE - version 2.5.0

[Link][github_commits_2_5_0] to a list of all commits between this release and
the previous one (2.4.0).

## New features

* New supported platform: i.MX7D ([#1639])
* Secure storage: anti-rollback protection for REE FS using RPMB FS ([#1630])
* Assign non-secure DDR configuration from DT if CFG_DT=y ([#1623])
* Add new image format: split image into three separate binaries suitable for
  upcoming ARM Trusted Firmware ([#1589]).
* Make alignment check configurable ([#1586])
* drivers: add TZC380 driver ([#1578])
* plat-imx: PSCI CPU off ([#1577])
* 64-bit paging on QEMU v8 and HiKey ([#1575], [#1592])
* Benchmark framework ([#1365])
* Dump call stack of user TAs on abort ([#1552])
* plat-hikey: enable Secure Data Path ([#1440])
* Add interface to load and decrypt/authenticate user TAs ([#1513])
* plat-ti: add secure paging support ([#1493])
* plat-ti: add OTP hardware key support ([#1492])
* Support ARM GICv3 ([#1465])

## Removed features

* stm-orly2 is not supported anymore ([#1650])
* Remove secure storage based on SQL FS (`CFG_SQL_FS=y`) ([#1490])
* Remove support for mapping user TAs with 1 MiB or 2 MiB granularity
  (`CFG_SMALL_PAGE_USER_TA=n`) ([#1559]). TAs are always mapped using small
  pages.

## Bug fixes

* Reduce size of non-pageable code ([#1621])
* Ignore `TA_FLAG_MULTI_SESSION` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` when
  `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` is not set ([#1574])
* libutee: remove buffering for AES GCM (PR#1573) and AES CTR ([#1580])
* Fix ROUNDUP()/ROUNDDOWN() macros ([#1519])
* Do not touch other bits in GICD_CTLR ([#1508])
* Fix build issue with `DEBUG=y` and `CFG_TEE_CORE_LOG_LEVEL=0` ([#1502])
* crypto: do not restrict hash size when algorithm is ECDSA ([#1497])

## Security fixes or enhancements

- crypto: fix RSA key leakage after fault injection attack
  ([OP-TEE-2016-0003][OP-TEE-2016-0003])  ([#1610])
* crypto: fix RSA key leakage after side channel attack
  ([OP-TEE-2016-0002][OP-TEE-2016-0002]) ([#1610])
* Make pager aliased pages not always writable ([#1551])
* Support for no-exec RO and RW data ([#1459], [#1550])

## New issues

* armv7: some platform-specific code (`plat_cpu_reset_early()`) overwrites
SCTLR bits configured by generic code. This affects alignment checks (`SCTLR.A`)
and write-implies-no-exec (`SCTLR.WXN`, `SCTLR.UWXN`), which can therefore not
be configured via the compile-time `CFG_` variables.
* armv7: plat-imx: Cortex-A9 cores should enable branch prediction (`SCLTR.Z`)
for improved performance.
* [#1656] qemu_armv8a: init hangs when secure data path and pager are both
  enabled.

## Tested on

In the list below, _standard_ means that the `xtest` program passed with
its default configuration, while _extended_ means it was run successfully
with the additional GlobalPlatform™ TEE Initial Configuration Test Suite
v1.1.0.4.

If a platform is not listed, it means the release was not tested on this
platform.

# OP-TEE - version 2.4.0

[Link][github_commits_2_4_0] to a list of all commits between this release and
the previous one (2.3.0).

Please note: this release is API-compatible with the previous one, but the
Secure Storage internal format for the REE and SQL FS is not compatible due to
commits [a238b74][commit_a238b74] ("core: REE FS: use the new hash tree
interface") and [44e900e][commit_44e900e] ("core: SQL FS: use the new hash tree
interface").

## New features

* Add porting guidelines

* Add support for Secure Data Path which allows Client and Trusted Applications
  to share references to secure memory

* New supported platform: Texas Instruments AM57xx (`PLATFORM=ti-am57xx`)

* ARMv7-A: add support for platform services in secure monitor and add these
  services for the DRA7xx platform

* SPI framework and PL022 driver cleanup and improvements

* Use CNTPCT (when available) to add entropy to the software PRNG

* Add GlobalPlatform Socket API for UDP and TCP (IPv4 and IPv6)

* DRA7: add TRNG driver, enable GICv2 driver

* Support load address larger than 4G

* libutee: preserve error code when calling TEE_Panic() for easier
  troubleshooting

## Bug fixes

* Secure storage: improve integrity checking of the REE and SQL filesystems by
  adding a hash tree on the internal data structures. Any external modification
  is detected, except full rollback. Fixes [#1188][issue1188].

* The linux driver will set the 'privileged' flag (TEE_GEN_CAP_PRIVILEGED) on
  the device intended for use by tee-supplicant. Fixes [#1199][issue1199].

* RPMB: don't try to program the RPMB key by default

* Fix "make clean" error cases

* Fix issue when resetting persistent storage enumerator [#1332][issue1332]

* Fix TA panic when doing AES CTS with specific buffer sizes
  [#1203][issue1203].

## Known issues

* On RPi3 xtest sometimes stall (rcu_sched self-detected stall on CPU) [#1353][issue1353]
* For multi-core PSCI support is to be added for ls1021atwr in OP-TEE.
* USB keyboard cannot be used to stop the u-boot timeout ([build issue131]).
* Travis service (build.git) seems unstable from time to time.

## Tested on

In the list below, _standard_ means that the `xtest` program passed with
its default configuration, while _extended_ means it was run successfully
with the additional GlobalPlatform™ TEE Initial Configuration Test Suite
v1.1.0.4.

# OP-TEE - version 2.3.0

[Link][github_commits_2_3_0] to a list of all commits between this release and
the previous one (2.2.0).

Please note: this release is API-compatible with the previous one, but the
Secure Storage internal format for the REE FS is not compatible due to commit
[361fb3e][commit_361fb3e] ("core: REE FS: use a single file per object").

[commit_361fb3e]: https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/commit/361fb3e

## New features

* New supported platform: Xilinx Zynq 7000 ZC702 (`PLATFORM=zynq7k-zc702`)

* Add debug assertions to spinlocks and mutexes

* Add more CP15 register access macros for Cortex-A9

* ARMv7-A: redesign secure monitor to make it easier to register services

* ARMv7-A: cleanup boot arguments

* libutee: extend `TEE_CheckMemoryAccessRights()` with
  `TEE_MEMORY_ACCESS_SECURE` and `TEE_MEMORY_ACCESS_NONSECURE`

* plat-hikey: enable SPI by default and add sample test code

* Consider `CFLAGS_ta_arm64` and `CFLAGS_ta_arm32` when building TAs

* Secure storage refactoring
  - Simplify interface with tee-supplicant. Minimize round trips with normal
    world, especially by adding a cache for FS RPC payload data.
  - REE FS: use a single file per object, remove block cache.

* Print call stack in panic()

## Bug fixes

* Fix UUID encoding when communicating with normal world (use big endian
  mode instead of native endianness). Related to this, the string format
  for UUIDs has changed in tee-supplicant, so that TA file names now follow
  the format defined in RFC4122 (a missing hyphen was added). The old format
  is still supported, but deprecated, and will likely be removed with the
  next major release.

* Drop write permission to non-writable ELF segments after TA loading is
  complete.

* mm: fix confusing memory mapping debug traces

* plat-ti: fix issues with MMU mapping

* crypto: fix clearing of big numbers

* build: allow spaces and double quotes in CFG_ variables

* mm: use paddr_t to support both 32- and 64-bit architectures properly.
  Resolves 32-bit truncation error when pool is at top of 32 bit address
  space on 64-bit architecture.

* plat-stm: support pager. Fix pager on ARMv7-A SMP boards.

* Fix debug output of Trusted Applications (remove "ERROR: TEE-CORE:" prefix)

* Do not consider TA memref parameters as TA private memory

* crypto: fix `cipher_final()` which would not call `cbc_done()` for CBC_MAC
  algorithms

* fix for 16-way PL310

* arm32: fix call stack unwinding (`print_stack()`)

* arm32: fix spinlock assembly code

* plat-stm, plat-imx: fix SCR initalization

* Fix user L1 MMU entries calculation (non-LPAE), allowing TTBCR.N values
  other than 7.

* mtk-mt8173: fix panic caused by incorrect size of SHMEM

* plat-stm: fix RNG driver (non-flat mapping)

## Known issues

* New issues open on GitHub
  * [#1203][issue1203] AES-CTS mode will fail when inlen=0x100, in_incr=0x80
  * [#1199][issue1199] Both tee and teepriv reported GlobalPlatform compliant
  * [#1188][issue1188] Secure storage (SQL FS and REE FS): blocks not tied to
    current meta header
  * [#1172][issue1172] paddr_t should be larger than 32 bits when
    CFG_WITH_LPAE is enabled

## Tested on

In the list below, _standard_ means that the `xtest` program passed with
its default configuration, while _extended_ means it was run successfully
with the additional GlobalPlatform™ TEE Initial Configuration Test Suite
v1.1.0.4.

# OP-TEE - version 2.1.0

## New features

* New supported platforms:
	* Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSOC
	* Spreadtrum SC9860

* GCC5 support

* Non Linear Mapping support: In OP-TEE kernel mode, the physical to virtual
  addresses was linear until this release, meaning the virtual addresses
  were equal to the physical addresses. This is no more the case in this
  release.

* Font rendering routines have been introduced in order to ease an
  implementation of Trusted UI.

* File Storage: Possibility to use the normal world filesystem and the RPMB
  implementations simultaneously.

* AOSP: There is a [local manifest][aosp_local_manifest] to build OP-TEE into an AOSP build, running on HiKey.
  Please refer to the README in that repo for instructions.

* OpenEmbedded: In addition to the makefile-based build described in the optee_os README, there is an
  [OpenEmbedded-based build][oe_build] that supports Qemu (32-bit), FVP (64-bit), and HiKey (64-bit).
  Please refer to the README in that repo for instructions.

# OP-TEE - version 2.0.0

## New features

* Generic driver: A new generic TEE driver is in the process of being
  [upstreamed][gendrv_v9].
  In this release, [OP-TEE/optee_linuxdriver][optee_linuxdriver] is no more used.
  Instead, linux v4.5 is being patched using the proposed Generic TEE Driver,
  as it can be found in [https://github.com/linaro-swg/linux/tree/optee][linux_optee]

* RPMB support: Secure Storage can now use Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) partition
  of an eMMC device. Check the [full documentation][rpmb_doc]

* Hard-float ABI is now available.

* [Link][github_commits_2_0_0] to a list of all commits between this and
  previous release.

* Support running 64-bits TA: on ARMv8-A platform, TA can be compiled in
  AArch32 and/or in AArch64 in case the core is compiled in AArch64.
  An example can be found in HiKey configuration file. Using the following
  excerpt code, the user TA libraries are compiled in both AArch32 and
  AArch64, and can be found in `out/arm-plat-hikey/export-ta_arm32` and
  `out/arm-plat-hikey/export-ta_arm64`

```
    ta-targets = ta_arm32
    ta-targets += ta_arm64
```

* Concurrent TA support: multiple TA can run in parallel on
  several cores.

* New tests added in xtest test suite: concurrent TA (xtest 1013),
  floating point tests (xtest 1006 and os_test TA) and corruption
  file storage (xtest 20000)

* [Link][github_commits_1_1_0] to a list of all commits between this and
  previous release.

# OP-TEE - version 1.0.0

OP-TEE is now maintained by Linaro. Contributors do not need to
sign a CLA anymore, but must follow the rules of the [DCO][DCO]
(Developer Certificate of Origin) instead.


## New features

* Add hardware support for Texas Instruments DRA7xx, ARMv7 (plat-ti)

* GlobalPlatform™ TEE Internal Core API Specification v1.1,
  including ECC algorithms.

* Secure Storage: Files stored by the REE are now encrypted. Operations
  are made atomic in order to prevent inconsistencies in case of errors
  during the storage operations. [Slides][LCStorage] describing the
  Secure Storage have been presented at the Linaro Connect SFO15.

* Change of format of the Trusted Applications: they follow a
  [signed ELF format][elf]

* Rework thread [synchronization][synchro] in optee_os.

* Use of ARMv8 native cryptographic support.

* [OP-TEE/optee_test][optee_test] test suite is released.

* Introduce [OP-TEE/manifest][manifest] and [OP-TEE/build][build]
  to setup and build QEMU, FVP, HiKey and Mediatek platforms. Setup scripts
  that used to be in optee_os have been removed, except for Juno board.

# OP-TEE - version 0.3.0

## New features

*   Add hardware support for
	*   Mediatek MT8173 Board, ARMv8-A (plat-mediatek)
	*   Hisilicon HiKey Board, ARMv8-A (plat-hikey)
*   AArch64 build of optee_os is now possible through the configuration `CFG_ARM64_core=y`
*	Secure Storage: Data can be encrypted prior to their storage in the non-secure.
	Build is configured using `CFG_ENC_FS=y`
*	A generic boot scheme can be used. Boot configuration is commonalized. This helps
	new board support. It is applied on plat-hikey, plat-vexpress, plat-mediatek, plat-stm
    and plat-vexpress.

# OP-TEE - version 0.2.0

## New features

### Linux Driver Refactoring

Linux Driver has been refactored. It is now split in two parts:
*	optee.ko, the generic Linux driver. It contains all functionality
	common to all backends.
*	optee_armtz.ko, a specific backend dedicated to the TrustZone optee.
	It depends on optee.ko.

Loading the TrustZone optee linux driver module is now performed using

    modprobe optee_armtz

Thanks to the dependency between the generic and the backend modules, optee.ko is then automatically loaded.

### Misc new features
* support PL310 lock down at TEE boot
* add 64bits support (division / print)

## Issues resolved since last release
N/A since this is the first release tag on OP-TEE.


## Known issues
*   Storage is implemented, but not "Secure storage", meaning that a client
    needs to do encrypt files on their own before storing the files.

*   Issue(s) open on GitHub
    *   [#95][pr95]: An error about building the test code of libtomcrypt.

    *   [#149][pr149]: when testing optee os with arm trusted firmware (I
	utilized optee os tee.bin as bl32 image) on juno platform, I got an
        error.

    *   [#161][pr161]: tee_svc_cryp.c lacks accessibility checks on
