## 1. Introduction
The `optee_os` git repository contains the source code of a Trusted Execution
Environment (TEE) as companion to a non-secure OS on ARM&reg;
Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone&reg; technology. This component meets the
[TEE System Architecture specifications](http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp)
and provides the
[TEE Internal Core API v1.1](http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp)
as defined by the
[GlobalPlatform Device technology TEE specifications](http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp)
for the development of
Trusted Applications. For a general overview of OP-TEE and to find out how to
contribute, please see the [Notice.md](Notice.md) file.

The Trusted OS is accessible from the Rich OS (Linux) using the
[GlobalPlatform TEE Client API Specification v1.0](http://www.globalplatform.org/specificationsdevice.asp),
which also is used to trigger secure execution of applications within the TEE.

## 3. Platforms supported
Several platforms are supported. In order to manage slight differences
between platforms, a `PLATFORM_FLAVOR` flag has been introduced.
The `PLATFORM` and `PLATFORM_FLAVOR` flags define the whole configuration
for a chip the where the Trusted OS runs. Note that there is also a
composite form which makes it possible to append `PLATFORM_FLAVOR` directly,
by adding a dash in-between the names. The composite form is shown below
for the different boards. For more specific details about build flags etc,
please read the file [build_system.md](documentation/build_system.md). Some
platforms have different sub-maintainers, please refer to the file
[MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS) for contact details for various platforms.

The **Maintained?** column shows:

- A green image if the platform is actively maintained: either tested successfully
  with the latest release (N), or is a newly supported platform.
- An orange image if the platform was last tested successfully with release N-1.
- A red image if the last successful test report is older.

Please see [build] for instructions how to run OP-TEE on various devices.

## 5. Coding standards
In this project we are trying to adhere to the same coding convention as used in
the Linux kernel (see [CodingStyle]). We achieve this by running [checkpatch]
from Linux kernel. However there are a few exceptions that we had to make since
the code also follows GlobalPlatform standards. The exceptions are as follows:

-	CamelCase for GlobalPlatform types are allowed.
-	And we also exclude checking third party code that we might use in this
	project, such as LibTomCrypt, MPA, newlib (not in this particular git, but
	those are also part of the complete TEE solution, see
	[Notice.md](Notice.md#repository-structure). The reason for
	excluding and not fixing third party code is because we would probably
	deviate too much from upstream and therefore it would be hard to rebase
	against those projects later on and we don't expect that it is easy to
	convince other software projects to change coding style.

Regarding the checkpatch tool, since it is licensed under the terms of GNU GPL
License Version 2, we
cannot include this script directly into this project. Please use checkpatch
directly from the Linux kernel git in combination with the local [checkpatch
script].
