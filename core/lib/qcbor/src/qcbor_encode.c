/*
 * == Nesting Tracking ==
 *
 * The following functions and data type QCBORTrackNesting implement
 * the nesting management for encoding.
 *
 * CBOR's two nesting types, arrays and maps, are tracked here. There
 * is a limit of QCBOR_MAX_ARRAY_NESTING to the number of arrays and
 * maps that can be nested in one encoding so the encoding context
 * stays small enough to fit on the stack.
 *
 * When an array/map is opened, pCurrentNesting points to the element
 * in pArrays that records the type, start position and accumulates a
 * count of the number of items added. When closed the start position
 * is used to go back and fill in the type and number of items in the
 * array/map.
 *
 * Encoded output can be a CBOR Sequence (RFC 8742) in which case
 * there is no top-level array or map. It starts out with a string,
 * integer or other non-aggregate type. It may have an array or map
 * other than at the start, in which case that nesting is tracked
 * here.
 *
 * QCBOR has a special feature to allow constructing byte string
 * wrapped CBOR directly into the output buffer, so no extra buffer is
 * needed for byte string wrapping.  This is implemented as nesting
 * with the type CBOR_MAJOR_TYPE_BYTE_STRING and is tracked here. Byte
 * string wrapped CBOR is used by COSE for data that is to be hashed.

/*
 * == Major CBOR Types ==
 *
 * Encoding of the major CBOR types is by these functions:
 *
 * CBOR Major Type  Public Function
 * 0                QCBOREncode_AddUInt64()
 * 0, 1             QCBOREncode_AddUInt64(), QCBOREncode_AddInt64()
 * 2, 3             QCBOREncode_AddBuffer()
 * 4, 5             QCBOREncode_OpenMapOrArray(), QCBOREncode_CloseMapOrArray(),
 *                  QCBOREncode_OpenMapOrArrayIndefiniteLength(),
 *                  QCBOREncode_CloseMapOrArrayIndefiniteLength()
 * 6                QCBOREncode_AddTag()
 * 7                QCBOREncode_AddDouble(), QCBOREncode_AddFloat(),
 *                  QCBOREncode_AddDoubleNoPreferred(),
 *                  QCBOREncode_AddFloatNoPreferred(), QCBOREncode_AddType7()
 *
 * Additionally, encoding of decimal fractions and bigfloats is by
 * QCBOREncode_AddExponentAndMantissa() and byte strings that wrap
 * encoded CBOR are handled by QCBOREncode_OpenMapOrArray() and
 * QCBOREncode_CloseBstrWrap2().
 *
 *
 * == Error Tracking Plan ==
 *
 * Errors are tracked internally and not returned until
 * QCBOREncode_Finish() or QCBOREncode_GetErrorState() is called. The
 * CBOR errors are in me->uError.  UsefulOutBuf also tracks whether
 * the buffer is full or not in its context.  Once either of these
 * errors is set they are never cleared. Only QCBOREncode_Init()
 * resets them. Or said another way, they must never be cleared or
 * we'll tell the caller all is good when it is not.
 *
 * Only one error code is reported by QCBOREncode_Finish() even if
 * there are multiple errors. The last one set wins. The caller might
 * have to fix one error to reveal the next one they have to fix.
 * This is OK.
 *
 * The buffer full error tracked by UsefulBuf is only pulled out of
 * UsefulBuf in QCBOREncode_Finish() so it is the one that usually
 * wins.  UsefulBuf will never go off the end of the buffer even if it
 * is called again and again when full.
 *
 * QCBOR_DISABLE_ENCODE_USAGE_GUARDS disables about half of the error
 * checks here to reduce code size by about 150 bytes leaving only the
 * checks for size to avoid buffer overflow. If the calling code is
 * completely correct, checks are completely unnecessary.  For
 * example, there is no need to check that all the opens are matched
 * by a close.
 *
 * QCBOR_DISABLE_ENCODE_USAGE_GUARDS also disables the check for more
 * than QCBOR_MAX_ITEMS_IN_ARRAY in an array. Since
 * QCBOR_MAX_ITEMS_IN_ARRAY is very large (65,535) it is very unlikely
 * to be reached. If it is reached, the count will wrap around to zero
 * and CBOR that is not well formed will be produced, but there will
 * be no buffers overrun and new security issues in the code.
 *
 * The 8 errors returned here fall into three categories:
 *
 * Sizes
 *   QCBOR_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_LARGE        -- Encoded output exceeded UINT32_MAX
 *   QCBOR_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL        -- Output buffer too small
 *   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_NESTING_TOO_DEEP  -- Nesting > QCBOR_MAX_ARRAY_NESTING1
 *   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_TOO_LONG          -- Too many items added to an array/map [1]
 *
 * Nesting constructed incorrectly
 *   QCBOR_ERR_TOO_MANY_CLOSES         -- More close calls than opens [1]
 *   QCBOR_ERR_CLOSE_MISMATCH          -- Type of close does not match open [1]
 *   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_OR_MAP_STILL_OPEN -- Finish called without enough closes [1]
 *
 * Would generate not-well-formed CBOR
 *   QCBOR_ERR_ENCODE_UNSUPPORTED      -- Simple type between 24 and 31 [1]
 *
 * [1] indicated disabled by QCBOR_DISABLE_ENCODE_USAGE_GUARDS

    * == Description of the CBOR Head ==
    *
    *    The head of a CBOR data item
    *  +---+-----+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+      +--------+
    *  |M T|  A R G U M E N T . . .                               |
    *  +---+-----+ +--------+ +--------+ +--------+ ...  +--------+
    *
    * Every CBOR data item has a "head". It is made up of the "major
    * type" and the "argument".
    *
    * The major type indicates whether the data item is an integer,
    * string, array or such. It is encoded in 3 bits giving it a range
    * from 0 to 7.  0 indicates the major type is a positive integer,
    * 1 a negative integer, 2 a byte string and so on.
    *
    * These 3 bits are the first part of the "initial byte" in a data
    * item.  Every data item has an initial byte, and some only have
    * the initial byte.
    *
    * The argument is essentially a number between 0 and UINT64_MAX
    * (18446744073709551615). This number is interpreted to mean
    * different things for the different major types. For major type
    * 0, a positive integer, it is value of the data item. For major
    * type 2, a byte string, it is the length in bytes of the byte
    * string. For major type 4, an array, it is the number of data
    * items in the array.
    *
    * Special encoding is used so that the argument values less than
    * 24 can be encoded very compactly in the same byte as the major
    * type is encoded. When the lower 5 bits of the initial byte have
    * a value less than 24, then that is the value of the argument.
    *
    * If the lower 5 bits of the initial byte are less than 24, then
    * they are the value of the argument. This allows integer values 0
    * - 23 to be CBOR encoded in just one byte.
    *
    * When the value of lower 5 bits are 24, 25, 26, or 27 the
    * argument is encoded in 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes following the initial
    * byte in network byte order (bit endian). The cases when it is
    * 28, 29 and 30 are reserved for future use. The value 31 is a
    * special indicator for indefinite length strings, arrays and
    * maps.
    *
    * The lower 5 bits are called the "additional information."
    *
    * Thus the CBOR head may be 1, 2, 3, 5 or 9 bytes long.
    *
    * It is legal in CBOR to encode the argument using any of these
    * lengths even if it could be encoded in a shorter length. For
    * example it is legal to encode a data item representing the
    * positive integer 0 in 9 bytes even though it could be encoded in
    * only 0. This is legal to allow for for very simple code or even
    * hardware-only implementations that just output a register
    * directly.
    *
    * CBOR defines preferred encoding as the encoding of the argument
    * in the smallest number of bytes needed to encode it.
    *
    * This function takes the major type and argument as inputs and
    * outputs the encoded CBOR head for them. It does conversion to
    * network byte order.  It implements CBOR preferred encoding,
    * outputting the shortest representation of the argument.
    *
    * == Endian Conversion ==
    *
    * This code does endian conversion without hton() or knowing the
    * endianness of the machine by using masks and shifts. This avoids
    * the dependency on hton() and the mess of figuring out how to
    * find the machine's endianness.
    *
    * This is a good efficient implementation on little-endian
    * machines.  A faster and smaller implementation is possible on
    * big-endian machines because CBOR/network byte order is
    * big-endian. However big-endian machines are uncommon.
    *
    * On x86, this is about 150 bytes instead of 500 bytes for the
    * original, more formal unoptimized code.
    *
    * This also does the CBOR preferred shortest encoding for integers
    * and is called to do endian conversion for floats.
    *
    * It works backwards from the least significant byte to the most
    * significant byte.
    *
    * == Floating Point ==
    *
    * When the major type is 7 and the 5 lower bits have the values
    * 25, 26 or 27, the argument is a floating-point number that is
    * half, single or double-precision. Note that it is not the
    * conversion from a floating-point value to an integer value like
    * converting 0x00 to 0.00, it is the interpretation of the bits in
    * the argument as an IEEE 754 float-point number.
    *
    * Floating-point numbers must be converted to network byte
    * order. That is accomplished here by exactly the same code that
    * converts integer arguments to network byte order.
    *
    * There is preferred encoding for floating-point numbers in CBOR,
    * but it is very different than for integers and it is not
    * implemented here.  Half-precision is preferred to
    * single-precision which is preferred to double-precision only if
    * the conversion can be performed without loss of precision. Zero
    * and infinity can always be converted to half-precision, without
    * loss but 3.141592653589 cannot.
    *
    * The way this function knows to not do preferred encoding on the
    * argument passed here when it is a floating point number is the
    * uMinLen parameter. It should be 2, 4 or 8 for half, single and
    * double precision floating point values. This prevents and the
    * incorrect removal of leading zeros when encoding arguments that
    * are floating-point numbers.
    *
    * == Use of Type int and Static Analyzers ==
    *
    * The type int is used here for several variables because of the
    * way integer promotion works in C for variables that are uint8_t
    * or uint16_t. The basic rule is that they will always be promoted
    * to int if they will fit. These integer variables here need only
    * hold values less than 255 so they will always fit into an int.
    *
    * Most of values stored are never negative, so one might think
    * that unsigned int would be more correct than int. However the C
    * integer promotion rules only promote to unsigned int if the
    * result won't fit into an int even if the promotion is for an
    * unsigned variable like uint8_t.
    *
    * By declaring these int, there are few implicit conversions and
    * fewer casts needed. Code size is reduced a little. It makes
    * static analyzers happier.
    *
    * Note also that declaring these uint8_t won't stop integer wrap
    * around if the code is wrong. It won't make the code more
    * correct.
