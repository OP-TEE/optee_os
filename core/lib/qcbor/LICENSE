QCBOR is available under what is essentially the 3-Clause BSD License.

Files created inside Qualcomm and open-sourced through CAF (The Code
Aurora Forum) have a slightly modified 3-Clause BSD License. The
modification additionally disclaims NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Files created after release to CAF use the standard 3-Clause BSD
License with no modification. These files have the SPDX license
identifier, "SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause" in them.
