/*
 * We split a TEE file into multiple blocks and store them
 * on REE filesystem. A TEE file is represented by a REE file
 * called meta and a number of REE files called blocks. Meta
 * file is used for storing file information, e.g. file size
 * and backup version of each block.
 *
 * REE files naming rule is as follows:
 *
 *   <tee_file_name>/meta.<backup_version>
 *   <tee_file_name>/block0.<backup_version>
 *   ...
 *   <tee_file_name>/block15.<backup_version>
 *
 * Backup_version is used to support atomic update operation.
 * Original file will not be updated, instead we create a new
 * version of the same file and update the new file instead.
 *
 * The backup_version of each block file is stored in meta
 * file (see @backup_version_table in tee_fs_private.h), the
 * meta file itself also has backup_version, the update is
 * successful after new version of meta has been written.
