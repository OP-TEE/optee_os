/*
 * Endianness Configuration
 *
 * This code is written so it will work correctly on big- and
 * little-endian CPUs without configuration or any auto-detection of
 * endianness. All code here will run correctly regardless of the
 * endianness of the CPU it is running on.
 *
 * There are four C preprocessor macros that can be set with #define
 * to explicitly configure endianness handling. Setting them can
 * reduce code size a little and improve efficiency a little.
 *
 * Note that most of QCBOR is unaffected by this configuration.  Its
 * endianness handling is integrated with the code that handles
 * alignment and preferred serialization. This configuration does
 * affect QCBOR's (planned) implementation of integer arrays (tagged
 * arrays) and use of the functions here to serialize or deserialize
 * integers and floating-point values.
 *
 * Following is the recipe for configuring the endianness-related
 * #defines.
 *
 * The first option is to not define anything. This will work fine
 * with all CPUs, OS's and compilers. The code for encoding integers
 * may be a little larger and slower.
 *
 * If your CPU is big-endian then define
 * USEFULBUF_CONFIG_BIG_ENDIAN. This will give the most efficient code
 * for big-endian CPUs. It will be small and efficient because there
 * will be no byte swapping.
 *
 * Try defining USEFULBUF_CONFIG_HTON. This will work on most CPUs,
 * OS's and compilers, but not all. On big-endian CPUs this should
 * give the most efficient code, the same as
 * USEFULBUF_CONFIG_BIG_ENDIAN does. On little-endian CPUs it should
 * call the system-defined byte swapping method which is presumably
 * implemented efficiently. In some cases, this will be a dedicated
 * byte swap instruction like Intel's bswap.
 *
 * If USEFULBUF_CONFIG_HTON works and you know your CPU is
 * little-endian, it is also good to define
 * USEFULBUF_CONFIG_LITTLE_ENDIAN.
 *
 * if USEFULBUF_CONFIG_HTON doesn't work and you know your system is
 * little-endian, try defining both USEFULBUF_CONFIG_LITTLE_ENDIAN and
 * USEFULBUF_CONFIG_BSWAP. This should call the most efficient
 * system-defined byte swap method. However, note
 * https://hardwarebug.org/2010/01/14/beware-the-builtins/.  Perhaps
 * this is fixed now. Often hton() and ntoh() will call the built-in
 * __builtin_bswapXX()() function, so this size issue could affect
 * USEFULBUF_CONFIG_HTON.
 *
 * Last, run the tests. They must all pass.
 *
 * These #define config options affect the inline implementation of
 * UsefulOutBuf_InsertUint64() and UsefulInputBuf_GetUint64().  They
 * also affect the 16-, 32-bit, float and double versions of these
 * functions. Since they are inline, the size effect is not in the
 * UsefulBuf object code, but in the calling code.
 *
 * Summary:
 *   USEFULBUF_CONFIG_BIG_ENDIAN -- Force configuration to big-endian.
 *   USEFULBUF_CONFIG_LITTLE_ENDIAN -- Force to little-endian.
 *   USEFULBUF_CONFIG_HTON -- Use hton(), htonl(), ntohl()... to
 *     handle big and little-endian with system option.
 *   USEFULBUF_CONFIG_BSWAP -- With USEFULBUF_CONFIG_LITTLE_ENDIAN,
 *     use __builtin_bswapXX().
 *
 * It is possible to run this code in environments where using floating point is
 * not allowed. Defining USEFULBUF_DISABLE_ALL_FLOAT will disable all the code
 * that is related to handling floating point types, along with related
 * interfaces. This makes it possible to compile the code with the compile
 * option -mgeneral-regs-only.

/**
 * @file UsefulBuf.h
 *
 * The goal of this code is to make buffer and pointer manipulation
 * easier and safer when working with binary data.
 *
 * The @ref UsefulBuf, @ref UsefulOutBuf and @ref UsefulInputBuf
 * structures are used to represent buffers rather than ad hoc
 * pointers and lengths.
 *
 * With these it is possible to write code that does little or no
 * direct pointer manipulation for copying and formatting data. For
 * example, the QCBOR encoder was written using these and has less
 * pointer manipulation.
 *
 * While it is true that object code using these functions will be a
 * little larger and slower than a white-knuckle clever use of
 * pointers might be, but not by that much or enough to have an effect
 * for most use cases. For security-oriented code this is highly
 * worthwhile. Clarity, simplicity, reviewability and are more
 * important.
 *
 * There are some extra sanity and double checks in this code to help
 * catch coding errors and simple memory corruption. They are helpful,
 * but not a substitute for proper code review, input validation and
 * such.
 *
 * This code consists of a lot of inline functions and a few that are
 * not.  It should not generate very much object code, especially with
 * the optimizer turned up to @c -Os or @c -O3.
 */


/**
 * @ref UsefulBufC and @ref UsefulBuf are simple data structures to
 * hold a pointer and length for binary data.  In C99 this data
 * structure can be passed on the stack making a lot of code cleaner
 * than carrying around a pointer and length as two parameters.
 *
 * This is also conducive to secure coding practice as the length is
 * always carried with the pointer and the convention for handling a
 * pointer and a length is clear.
 *
 * While it might be possible to write buffer and pointer code more
 * efficiently in some use cases, the thought is that unless there is
 * an extreme need for performance (e.g., you are building a
 * gigabit-per-second IP router), it is probably better to have
 * cleaner code you can be most certain about the security of.
 *
 * The non-const @ref UsefulBuf is usually used to refer an empty
 * buffer to be filled in.  The length is the size of the buffer.
 *
 * The const @ref UsefulBufC is usually used to refer to some data
 * that has been filled in. The length is amount of valid data pointed
 * to.
 *
 * A common use mode is to pass a @ref UsefulBuf to a function, the
 * function puts some data in it, then the function returns a @ref
 * UsefulBufC refering to the data. The @ref UsefulBuf is a non-const
 * "in" parameter and the @ref UsefulBufC is a const "out" parameter
 * so the constness stays correct. There is no single "in,out"
 * parameter (if there was, it would have to be non-const).  Note that
 * the pointer returned in the @ref UsefulBufC usually ends up being
 * the same pointer passed in as a @ref UsefulBuf, though this is not
 * striclty required.
 *
 * A @ref UsefulBuf is null, it has no value, when @c ptr in it is
 * @c NULL.
 *
 * There are functions and macros for the following:
 *  - Initializing
 *  - Create initialized const @ref UsefulBufC from compiler literals
 *  - Create initialized const @ref UsefulBufC from NULL-terminated string
 *  - Make an empty @ref UsefulBuf on the stack
 *  - Checking whether a @ref UsefulBuf is null, empty or both
 *  - Copying, copying with offset, copying head or tail
 *  - Comparing and finding substrings
 *
 * See also @ref UsefulOutBuf. It is a richer structure that has both
 * the size of the valid data and the size of the buffer.
 *
 * @ref UsefulBuf is only 16 or 8 bytes on a 64- or 32-bit machine so
 * it can go on the stack and be a function parameter or return value.
 *
 * Another way to look at it is this. C has the NULL-terminated string
 * as a means for handling text strings, but no means or convention
 * for binary strings. Other languages do have such means, Rust, an
 * efficient compiled language, for example.
 *
 * @ref UsefulBuf is kind of like the Useful Pot Pooh gave Eeyore on
 * his birthday.  Eeyore's balloon fits beautifully, "it goes in and
 * out like anything".

/**
 * UsefulOutBuf is a structure and functions (an object) for
 * serializing data into a buffer to encode for a network protocol or
 * write data to a file.
 *
 * The main idea is that all the pointer manipulation is performed by
 * @ref UsefulOutBuf functions so the caller doesn't have to do any
 * pointer manipulation.  The pointer manipulation is centralized.
 * This code has been reviewed and written carefully so it
 * spares the caller of much of this work and results in safer code
 * with less effort.
 *
 * The @ref UsefulOutBuf methods that add data to the output buffer
 * always check the length and will never write off the end of the
 * output buffer. If an attempt to add data that will not fit is made,
 * an internal error flag will be set and further attempts to add data
 * will not do anything.
 *
 * There is no way to ever write off the end of that buffer when
 * calling the @c UsefulOutBuf_AddXxx() and
 * @c UsefulOutBuf_InsertXxx() functions.
 *
 * The functions to add data do not report success of failure. The
 * caller only needs to check for an error in the final call, either
 * UsefulOutBuf_OutUBuf() or UsefulOutBuf_CopyOut() to get the
 * result. This makes the calling code cleaner.
 *
 * There is a utility function to get the error status anytime along
 * the way for a special circumstance. There are functions to see how
 * much room is left and see if some data will fit too, but their use
 * is generally unnecessary.
 *
 * The general call flow is:
 *
 *    - Initialize by calling @ref UsefulOutBuf_Init(). The output
 *      buffer given to it can be from the heap, stack or
 *      otherwise. @ref UsefulOutBuf_MakeOnStack is a convenience
 *      macro that makes a buffer on the stack and initializes it.
 *
 *    - Call methods like UsefulOutBuf_InsertString(),
 *      UsefulOutBuf_AppendUint32() and UsefulOutBuf_InsertUsefulBuf()
 *      to output data. The append calls add data to the end of the
 *      valid data. The insert calls take a position argument.
 *
 *    - Call UsefulOutBuf_OutUBuf() or UsefulOutBuf_CopyOut() to see
 *      there were no errors and to get the serialized output bytes.
 *
 * @ref UsefulOutBuf can be used in a mode to calculate the size of
 * what would be output without actually outputting anything.  This is
 * useful to calculate the size of a buffer that is to be allocated to
 * hold the output. See @ref SizeCalculateUsefulBuf.
 *
 * Methods like UsefulOutBuf_InsertUint64() always output in network
 * byte order (big endian).
 *
 * The possible errors are:
 *
 *  - The @ref UsefulOutBuf was not initialized or was corrupted.
 *
 *  - An attempt was made to add data that will not fit.
 *
 *  - An attempt was made to insert data at a position beyond the end of
 *    the buffer.
 *
 *  - An attempt was made to insert data at a position beyond the valid
 *    data in the buffer.
 *
 * Some inexpensive simple sanity checks are performed before every
 * data addition to guard against use of an uninitialized or corrupted
 * UsefulOutBuf.
 *
 * @ref UsefulOutBuf has been used to create a CBOR encoder. The CBOR
 * encoder has almost no pointer manipulation in it, is easier to
 * read, and easier to review.
 *
 * A @ref UsefulOutBuf is small and can go on the stack:
 *   - 32 bytes (27 bytes plus alignment padding) on a 64-bit CPU
 *   - 16 bytes (15 bytes plus alignment padding) on a 32-bit CPU

/**
 * @ref UsefulInputBuf is the counterpart to @ref UsefulOutBuf. It is
 * for parsing data received.  Initialize it with the data from the
 * network. Then use the functions like UsefulInputBuf_GetBytes() to
 * get data chunks of various types. A position cursor is maintained
 * internally.
 *
 * As long as the functions here are used, there will never be any
 * reference off the end of the given buffer (except
 * UsefulInputBuf_SetBufferLength()). This is true even if they are
 * called incorrectly, an attempt is made to seek off the end of the
 * buffer or such. This makes it easier to write safe and correct
 * code.  For example, the QCBOR decoder implementation is safer and
 * easier to review through its use of @ref UsefulInputBuf.
 *
 * @ref UsefulInputBuf maintains an internal error state.  The
 * intended use is fetching data chunks without any error checks until
 * the end.  If there was any error, such as an attempt to fetch data
 * off the end, the error state is entered and no further data will be
 * returned. In the error state the @c UsefulInputBuf_GetXxxx()
 * functions return 0, or @c NULL or @ref NULLUsefulBufC. As long as
 * null is not dereferenced, the error check can be put off until the
 * end, simplifying the calling code.
 *
 * The integer and float parsing expects network byte order (big
 * endian).  Network byte order is what is used by TCP/IP, CBOR and
 * most internet protocols.
 *
 * Lots of inline functions are used to keep code size down. The
 * optimizer, particularly with the @c -Os or @c -O3, also reduces
 * code size a lot. The only non-inline code is
 * UsefulInputBuf_GetBytes().  It is less than 100 bytes so use of
 * @ref UsefulInputBuf doesn't add much code for all the messy
 * hard-to-get right issues with parsing binary protocols in C that it
 * solves.
 *
 * The parse context size is:
 *   - 64-bit machine: 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 (+ 5 bytes padding to align) = 32 bytes
 *   - 32-bit machine: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 (+ 1 byte padding to align) = 16 bytes
