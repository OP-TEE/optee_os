# It can happen that a makefile calls us, which contains an 'export' directive
# or the '.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES:' special target. In this case, all the make
# variables are added to the environment for each line of the recipes, so that
# any sub-makefile can use them.
# We have observed this can cause issues such as 'Argument list too long'
# errors as the shell runs out of memory.
# Since this Makefile won't call any sub-makefiles, and since the commands do
# not expect to implicitely obtain any make variable from the environment, we
# can safely cancel this export mechanism. Unfortunately, it can't be done
# globally, only by name. Let's unexport MAKEFILE_LIST which is by far the
# biggest one due to our way of tracking dependencies and compile flags
# (we include many *.cmd and *.d files).

# Automatically delete corrupt targets (file updated but recipe exits with a
